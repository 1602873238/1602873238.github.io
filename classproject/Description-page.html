                    <p>Many people say "sad" after <br> reading this book, so<br> why should we read a book <br>that makes us sad? Some books<br> are light, but the life described<br> in them is heavy.</p>

        <h1>INFO</h1>
        <h3>This is a heartbreaking story.</h3>
        <p>A rich young master, the son of a servant and a relationship that seems impossible to be friends. Hassan, the hero, devoted his whole life to the goodness in his heart. This greatness of human nature made countless readers summon up courage to read and feel the concise text of this book, and then flourished infinite friendship and love.</p>
        <h4>COMMENTS</h4>
        <p>Exquisite. A wonderfully conjured story that offers a glimpse into an Afghanistan most Americans have never seen, and depicts a side of humanity rarely revealed.</p><br>
        <p>A moving portrait of modern Afghanistan, from its pre-Russian-invasion glory days through the terrible reign of the Taliban. </p><br>
        <p>A beautiful novel. Ranks among the best-written and most provocative stories of the year so far. Hosseini is an exhilaratingly original writer with a gift for irony and a gentle, perspective heart. </p><br>
        <p>As Amir's father said, when he chose to steal Ali's wife and Hassan's mother, he decided that he would spend the rest of his life in guilt and atonement. When Amir chose to watch Hassan's invasion and framed Hassan, he was destined to suffer a great deal in his heart-even in a distant country, he could not eliminate it.</p><br>
        <h4>"For you, Qian Qian is a million times."</h4><br>
        <p>This sentence appears three times in total: one is Hassan chasing kites for Amir, the other is farid vs Amir, and the third is Amir vs Solabo. I think Amir finally found himself in that dream, brave, confident and responsible.</p><br>
